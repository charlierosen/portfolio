Entry for the BlueDot Def/Acc (defensive accelerationism) hackathon. The project contains two security-focused applications in a single monorepo.

## Honeypot Guardrail

A protective layer that detects SQL injection attacks using a combination of ML classification (via Gemini) and regex heuristics. Instead of simply blocking malicious queries, it returns **synthetic data** — making it harder for attackers to tell they've been caught.

- Streamlit-based interface for testing
- SAFE/BLOCKED decision logic with Gemini AI fallback
- Intentionally vulnerable query layer for demonstration purposes

## Fact Checker

A Chrome browser extension paired with a FastAPI backend that validates claims in real time. Highlight text on any page, and the extension will search for evidence and return a verdict.

- Extracts claims from highlighted text or scans entire pages
- Generates search queries via Gemini and retrieves web evidence
- Colour-coded results: red (false), amber (uncertain), blue (mixed), green (verified)
- Source visualisation graphs showing evidence chains
- Budget-aware API processing for page-wide scans

## Tech Stack

Python, JavaScript, Streamlit, FastAPI, Gemini API, Chrome Extension APIs
