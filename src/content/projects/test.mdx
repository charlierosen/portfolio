This project powers the site you&apos;re currently viewing. Built with **Next.js 13**, styled with custom CSS,
and sourced from **MDX** content via Contentlayer. Continuous deployment runs on **Vercel**.


Highlights:

- Dynamic blog cards and hero design.
- Contentlayer-driven MDX with per-post hero imagery.
- Optimized for deployment on Vercel&apos;s edge network.
