An automated trading bot that trades NASDAQ-100 stocks using a momentum filtering strategy with performance-weighted position sizing.

## Strategy

The bot applies a cascading filter across multiple timeframes:

1. Select the **50 best-performing** stocks over 12 months
2. Narrow to the **30 best** over 6 months
3. Pick the **top 10** over 3 months

The portfolio rebalances at each refresh cycle, with position sizes weighted by recent performance. The idea is that momentum tends to persist over medium-term horizons — stocks that have been rising are more likely to continue rising.

## Implementation

- Connects to the **Alpaca** trading API for order execution
- Uses **yfinance** for historical price data
- Supports multiple scheduling modes: 10-minute, daily, and weekly rebalancing
- Performance tracked via a minimalist **Flask** dashboard
- Deployed on an **AWS EC2** instance for always-on operation

## Results

Achieved a **+15.6% return** over the period 17/09 – 27/12/2024 in a simplified paper trading environment.

## Tech Stack

Python, Alpaca API, yfinance, SQLite, Flask, AWS EC2
