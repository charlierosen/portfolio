Ongoing astrophysics research with the (E-)INSPIRE group, investigating galaxy evolution through primordial relic galaxies.

## What Are Relic Galaxies?

Relic galaxies are massive galaxies that formed most of their stars very early in the universe's history and have remained largely unchanged since. They offer a direct window into conditions in the early universe — studying them helps us understand how galaxies form and evolve.

## Approach

The project uses the E-INSPIRE I master catalogue and data from the DESI and SDSS surveys. The analysis pipeline involves:

1. **ML Regression** — predicting the Degree of Relicness (DoR) for candidate galaxies using a variety of regression methods.
2. **Spectral Stacking** — clustering galaxies and stacking their spectra to create high signal-to-noise composites.
3. **Spectral Fitting** — fitting stacked spectra using pPXF (penalised pixel-fitting) to derive stellar population properties like age, metallicity, and star formation history.
